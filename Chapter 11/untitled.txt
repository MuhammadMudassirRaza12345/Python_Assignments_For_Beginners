Create a class C-2d vector and use it to create another class representing a 3-d vector.
Create a class of pets from a class Animals and further create class Dog from Pets. Add a method bark to class Dog.
Create a class Employee and add salary and increment properties to it.
Write a method SalaryAfterIncrement method with a @property decorator with a setter which changes the value of increment based on the salary.

Write a class complex to represent complex numbers, along with overloaded operators + and * which adds and multiplies them.
Write a class vector representing a vector of n dimension. Overload the + and * operator which calculates the sum and the dot product of them.
Write __str__() method to print the vector as follows:
7i + 8j + 10k
Assume vector of dimension 3 for this problem.

Override the __len__() method on vector of problem 5 to display the dimension of the vector.
Project 2: Snake, Water, Gun Game
We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher number please”.

When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

Hint: Use the random module
